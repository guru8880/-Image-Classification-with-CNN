# CIFAR-10 CNN Classification

Objective: Build and train a Convolutional Neural Network to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Deliverables:
- Jupyter notebook with code
- Model architecture (in notebook)
- Accuracy & loss graphs
- Confusion matrix
- Saved model file (cifar10_cnn.h5)

How to run:
1. Create and activate venv: `python -m venv venv` then `venv\Scripts\activate`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Create a Jupyter kernel for the venv (instructions in notebook)
4. Launch Jupyter: `jupyter lab`
5. Open and run `cifar10_cnn.ipynb`
